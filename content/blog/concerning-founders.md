# Concerning Founders

For young startups, the founding team is the biggest identifier of future success. At the end of the day investors are people and your business is made of people. Investors need to deeply respect you and your core team members before they make any investment decisions. If they donâ€™t spend time getting to know you personally, then beware, because this investor has ulterior motives and they will use their voting shares to push a different agenda.

This is one of the only places to truly boast (honestly, of course). The details here will pique investors interests. Name drop any Fortune 500 companies that were past employers, partners, or clients of your team members. Mention all academic degrees, publications, certifications, and certificates. Also make sure everything you write or say about someone is already on their LinkedIn profile and defensible upon due diligence.

On the quantitative value statements, showcase that your team is well-rounded overall. The diversity of skills/experiences should cover all the operations in your business model and necessary industry connections.
